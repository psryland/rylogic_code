HowTo Debug/Develop:
	1) Launch VSCode, open the project folder
	2) At the terminal: npm install
	   This restores the packages
	3) F5 should Launch a new VSCode Experimental instance and set the typescript compiler service (tsc) in watch mode

HowTo Publish:
	1) Sign into the marketplace then click on your account name in the top right. This takes you to dev.azure.com
	2) Click on your organisation. This takes you to 'https://rylogic.visualstudio.com/'
	3) Click on the 'User settings' icon (left of the account icon) in the top right and select "Personal Access Tokens"
	4) Change the 'organisation' option to 'All accessible organisations' - dunno why, but it doesn't work if you don't.
	5) Make a new token, full access
	6) You should now have a token: 52 character base64 string.  ** DON'T SAVE THIS SOMEWHERE THAT GETS UPLOADED TO GITHUB **
	7) From a command prompt in the root project folder type:
		vsce publish -p <token>

	vsce is an npm thing, it builds the vsix package and uploads it

Errors:	
	Failed request: (401) = You forgot to make the token 'All accessible organisations'

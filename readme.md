## Building

This project is only used on windows. Compiling requires MSBuild, dotnet, dotnet-script.
Follow these steps to build:

- Pull to a clean directory,
- Ensure the 'dotnet-script' tool is installed (use `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`),
- Customise _/script/UserVars.csx_ or _/script/UserVars.json_ as needed,
- Run `dotnet-script ./script/Build.csx` to build projects from the command line, or, open _Rylogic.sln_ in Visual Studio.

This repo is actively developed, often refactored, and frequently broken. It is public so that the source for my released projects is publicly available.

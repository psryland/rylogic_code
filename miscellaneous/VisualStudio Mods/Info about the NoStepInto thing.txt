Visual Studio 8.0 (Whidbey)

Not sure when it happened, but beta 2 anyway requires this to be in HKLM not HKCU so the full reg path is now HKLM\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\NativeDE\StepOver. Yes, that means you need to be an Admin to set it up, and it is set for all users of your box. That's what happens when features aren't "official".

 
Advanced Features

The debugger supports additional escapes over and above the normal Visual Studio regular expression syntax, but note that even I have never tried these so YMMV. I got this list from comments in the source. Well I'm sure you know that such things cannot always be trusted 100%, but here they are anyway:

\cid      A C/C++ identifier
\funct   A C/C++ function name
\scope  A set of class/namespace specifiers for a function (e.g. ATL::CFoo::CBar::)
\anything         any string
\oper    A C/C++ operator

 

Additional Examples

These examples are shown exactly how you would enter them via RegEdit, not in the more cumbersome .reg format. The numbers are arbitrary, but in the multi-line examples their relative values are important to get the right ordering.

Don’t step into members of CString[AWT] etc:

1          \scope:CString.*\:\:.*=NoStepInto

Don’t step into overloaded operators:

10        \scope:operator\oper:=NoStepInto

Don’t step into ATL:: except for CComBSTRs non-operator members:

20        ATL\:\:CComBSTR::\funct:=StepInto

10        ATL\:\:.*=NoStepInto

Don’t step into templated things, unless they are merely templated functions in a non-templated class:

20        \scope:\funct:=StepInto

10        .*[\<\>].NoStepInto

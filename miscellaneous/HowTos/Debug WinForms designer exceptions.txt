1 - In the project that's causing a problem, goto properties->debug
    Set 'Start external program' to '<path>\devenv.exe' with args '/rootsuffix Exp'
2 - Start debugging the project
    This starts a new instance of VS
3 - Open the project in the new VS instance,
    'OK' the warning about already being loaded
4 - You probably need to turn off first-chance exception messages in the output window of the first VS instance
5 - Do the thing in the second VS instance that causes the error
6 - It's REALLY slow tho... make a coffee..

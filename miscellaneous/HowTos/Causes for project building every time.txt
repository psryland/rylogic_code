Usually because of a header file that doesn't exist on disk

Turn on: Options -> Projects and Solutions -> Build and Run -> MSBuild project build output verbosity = Diagnostic
Build the project (twice, the first build is a legitimate change)
Scroll to the top, the reason for the rebuild should be shown.

If not shown, search of 'is newer' to find causes of a rebuild

Also, check that the dependencies are being updated with each build and you're not accidently using an old version
e.g. copying an old copy of a dll to the output directory, instead of the version build as a dependency

Note:
  The line "'unsuccessfulbuild' because "AlwaysCreate" was specified" (or similar) happens when
  MSBuild has detected a change. MSBuild creates the unsuccessfulbuild file as part of the build
  process to force a rebuild. It is not the original cause of the rebuild.
  
Note:
  After a windows update, I was seeing project rebuilds because 'c:\windows\system32\tzres.dll' had
  a modified time 24 hours in the future. Must be a MS bug.

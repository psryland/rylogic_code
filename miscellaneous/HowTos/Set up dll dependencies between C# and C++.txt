In the C# project:
Create folders:
	lib\
		x86\
			debug\
				native.dll
			release\
				native.dll
		x64\
			debug\		
				native.dll
			release\
				native.dll

Set all of the 'native.dll' to Build Action=None
Set the project dependencies in the solution so that the C# project is dependent on the native dll project (if in the same solution)
Use the post_build.py script to copy the native.dll to the target directory as a post build step.

If Build Action is not None, the build dependency checker causes a rebuild each time because msbuild thinks the native.dlls are newer than the project.pdb
You can use Copy If Newer, however I've normally been using a post_build.py script

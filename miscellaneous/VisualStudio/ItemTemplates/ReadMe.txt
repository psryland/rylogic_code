Update new file templates by editing the templates in:
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplatesCache\

1) Make a backup folder and put the existing files in there
2) Copy the files you want to change back to the original location
3) Edit as needed

Apparently editing the files in here doesn't have any effect:
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\

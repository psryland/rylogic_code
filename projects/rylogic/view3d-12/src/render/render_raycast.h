		// Notes:
		//  - This render step can be used in three main ways:
		//    1. Immediate ray casts: Call 'SetRays' followed by 'ExecuteImmediate' to perform a ray cast and read
		//       the results on the CPU immediately. This is the simplest way to use this render step, but it blocks
		//       the CPU until the GPU has completed the ray cast.
		//    2. Async ray casts: Call 'SetRays' followed by 'ExecuteAsync' to submit the ray cast to the GPU and
		//       return immediately. Results are reported via the callback passed to 'ExecuteAsync' when the GPU completes.
		//    3. As part of a render frame: Call 'SetRays'. After a scene render, the hit results will be reported back via
		//       the results callback supplied at construction.

Elements:

 Scientists discover that the star in your solar system is in the last stages of its life and will go supernova
 within a few years. The only hope for the survival of your civilisation is to build a space craft capable of
 leaving your solar system. Unfortunately the materials and technology needed to achieve this have not yet been
 discovered. As the foremost authority in material sciences, you are tasked with discovering the materials needed
 to build the space craft that will ultimately be the salvation of your civilisation.

 Aim:
  Discover the materials needed to build a space craft capable of reaching escape velocity from your solar system
  transporting as many of your population as possible before your solar system is destroyed.
  (Time frame = time till super nova, points = number of population saved)

 Building a suitable space craft relies on advancing materials and technology in four main areas:
  Fuel, Structural materials, Computing technology, Energy Shields

 Fuel is needed to supply power to the space craft. This includes the energy needed to propel the craft to escape
  velocity, as well as meet the energy requirements of the life support, computer systems, and shields. The fuel
  itself has weight which increases the energy requirement for the craft. Fuel weight reduces the number of your
  population that can be saved. Fuel research is a quest to maximise the energy / weight (energy density) of the
  material you choose to use for fuel.

 Structural Materials:
  are the materials you need to build the space craft from. The ideal material for building
  a space craft is one that is extremely light, yet strong enough to survive the launch and powered flight. In 
  this line of research, a material that maximises its strength to weight ratio should be sort.

 Computing Systems:
  controls the life support, navigation, and other systems of the space craft. Materials used in
  the computing technology must be as energy efficient as possible to reduce the fuel requirement. Since the most energy
  efficient computer systems are all based on optical technology, a material that minimises optical resistence and
  weight is needed.

 Energy Shields:
  are needed to protect the space craft and its occupants from the radiation and debris encountered
  when travelling through space. It is already known that some materials exhibit a weak field that repels particles
  and radiation. By suppling energy to these materials the effect can be amplified. Research is needed to find a
  material in which this effect is sufficient to protect the space craft.

 As the lead researcher, your tasks are:
  -to suggest the ways in which materials should be combined so as to hopefully produce new materials more suited
   to space craft construction
  -to create the specifications for the space craft:
     -how many people it will carry
       => size
          => amount of material needed, material strength => energy needed for escape velocity
          => time to build
       => range of protective field => energy needed
       => computer systems needed => energy needed
       energy needed => amount of fuel => weight => energy needed

 Game Systems:
  Start with a random set of materials with random properties.
  Inventory of materials increases with time based on rarity and time since discovered.
  Player chooses combinations of known materials with a limited set of ratios, ie. 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5 in the hope
   of discovering new materials.
  Certain combinations of materials result in discoveries, once a material is discovered it becauses a known material.
  Player has a set of variables for the space craft spec. They choose when to test the design. An iterative physical
   simulation determines the viability of the craft. A percentage of the materials used in the test craft are consumed
 The materials that can be discovered are generated randomly on game start by starting with four ideal materials and
  generating backwards to produce enough intermediate materials (game difficulty control, more = harder)

 Physics:
  Escape Velocity = Sqrt(2 * G * M / r), G = 6.67x10^-11 m³kg^-1s^-2, M = star mass, r = distance from star
  Energy Required = 0.5 * ship_mass * (Escape Velocity)^2
  Shield field strength = A / (Br² + 1), A = Input energy, B = Materials field falloff

 Material generation:
  Start with four materials suitably choosen to save 1000 people given the star mass and distance from star
  Create an empty set of starting materials
  Create an empty set of allowed materials
  Generate a random material M1.
  Choose M2, such that Combine(a * M1, b * M2) = IdealFuel (a,b are randomly choosen combination ratios)
  Add IdealFuel to allowed materials, M1,M2 to starting materials
  Generate a random material or choose from starting materials, call it M3 (may want to bias this)
  Choose M4, such that Combine(a * M3, b * M4) = IdealMetal
  Add IdealMetal to allowed materials, M3,M4 to starting materials
  Repeat for IdealTech and IdealSheild
  while number of final materials < number to create
     Remove material M from the starting materials
     Choose from the starting materials or randomly generate a material N (bias as needed)
     Choose O such that Combine(a * N, b * O) = M
     Add M to the allowed materials, O and N to the starting materials

 The game starts with a subset of the starting materials, the remaining starting materials are 'discovered'
 at random intervals throughout the first quarter of the time till super nova

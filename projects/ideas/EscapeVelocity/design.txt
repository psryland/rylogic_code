Escape Velocity:

 Scientists discover that the star in your solar system is in the last stages of its life and will go supernova
 within a year. The only hope for the survival of your civilisation is to build a space craft capable of
 leaving your solar system. Your civilisation has a number of existing known materials but none is currently
 suitable for this task. As the leading scientist of your time, you are tasked with researching new materials and
 designing a space craft that will ultimately be the salvation of your civilisation.

 Building a suitable space craft essentially boils down to two goals, choosing a material from which to build the
 craft, and finding a fuel (combination of materials) that can provide the thrust needed to achieve escape velocity.
 
 Player objective:
  Discover the materials needed to build a space craft capable of reaching escape velocity from your solar system
  transporting as many of your population as possible before your solar system is destroyed.
  (Time frame = time till super nova, points = number of population saved)

 Game-play:
  Each game is different due to a randomly chosen number of electrons per orbital for the elements in the game universe.
  All materials are the combination of two elements only (in the required ratios to produce stable combinations).
  The player starts with a set of materials that they can combine to produce new materials. The combination
  processes model real chemical reaction processes so that the player is able to roughly predict the outcome
  of reacting two materials.
  The materials the player is trying to find are:
   - a strong ship building material (strongly bonded material with low atomic weight, highly ionic)
   - two materials that react vigorously to use as fuel (materials that produce a strong exothermic reaction and hence
     produce a high exhaust velocity). Atomic weight of the fuel is also important as it effects the mass of the ship.
  The names of the elements are chosen randomly. The material names are then derived based on the ratio of elements
   in the material. e.g. moronium (Mr) and bananite (Ba) in MrBa2 = moronium-di-bananite
  The reaction of two materials can be endothermic or exothermic. Endothermic reactions require energy input which
   defines the rate that the material can be produced, exothermic reactions happen instantly. Players will likely
   need endothermic reactions to produce the two elements needed for fuel.

 Game Views:
  There are three main views in the game:
  -Home View
    -shows a countdown timer till the star explodes, the star mass, distance from the star
    -shows a summary of the known materials and how much you have in your stockpile.
    -shows a summary of your current leading ship design
  -Ship Design view
    -where you choose what materials to use for your ship and fuel
    -the number of passengers your ship will carry
    -the mass of fuel to carry
    -the rate the ship will burn the fuel
  -Material Lab view
    -the interface for combining materials
    -show detailed info about materials (name, elements, atomic weight, rarity, periodic table?)

 Physics:
  Escape Velocity = Sqrt(2 * G * M / r), G = 6.67x10^-11 m³kg^-1s^-2, M = star mass, r = distance from star
  Rocket Thrust:
    Assume rocket constructed in space, only gravity influence is the star
    mass(t)         = total_mass - t*mass_flow_rate
	max_burn_time   = fuel_mass / mass_flow_rate
	velocity(t)     = integrate(acceleration(t)) from 0 to t
	acceleration(t) = total_force(t) / mass(t)
	total_force(t)  = gravity_force(t) + thrust_force
	thrust_force    = exhaust_velocity * mass_flow_rate + (pressure_at_nozzle_exit - atmospheric_pressure) * area_of_nozzle_exit
	gravity_force   = G * star_mass * mass(t) / distance(t)²
	distance(t)     = initial_distance + integrate(velocity(t)) from 0 to t
	max_velocity    = velocity(max_burn_time)
   Assuming space flight only, so atmospheric_pressure = 0
   Assuming thrust_force is constant, i.e. mass_flow_rate and exhaust_velocity are constant
   escape velocity is reached if max_velocity > escape_velocity
   Note, circular dependency: velocity->accel->gravity_force->distance->velocity hence, iterative solver needed
   Temperature:
    As the star gets closer to supernova, the local temperature increases, remember to consider the melting points
    of the ship material and fuel.
    T(d) = Ts * sqrt(Rs / 2*d)
    where:
      Ts = average sun temperature ~ 6000K.
      Rs = sun radius ~ 695,000km
      d = average distance sun-planet ~ 149,600,000km
      T = average planet temperature. ~16.18°C
  Containment Pressure:
    The player will decide the containment pressure for each fuel component.
    Each material will have a relationship between container wall thickness and max pressure
    Containment pressure therefore effects total ship mass
	The fuel materials will have a matter state for the containment pressure and average local temperature
	If the fuel is a gas then the density/volume are related by the ideal gas equation PV = nRT
	 P = pressure, V = volume, n = molar mass, R = gas constant, T = temperature
	 

 Chemistry:
  The chemistry of materials is defined by the valences of the elements (electrons per level). In our universe these
  are: 2,8,8,18,18,32. The atomic weight of an element is the number of electrons it has (in its non-ionised state),
  the number of electrons relative to how filled each valence level is controls how two elements react, how strongly
  they become bonded when in a material.
  In this simplified model, materials always consist of two elements (in various ratios)
  Stability of a material depends on how close to filling the valence levels the element combination is
  
  The ideal material to build the space craft out of is a strong/light metal alloy. There doesn't seem to be any
  periodic table inspired pattern for what makes an allow strong, so pick a light metal and the elements that from the
  highest total bond energy

 Game Systems:
  Start with a random set of materials with random properties.
  Inventory of materials increases with time based on rarity and time since discovered.
  Player chooses combinations of known materials with a limited set of ratios, i.e. 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5 in the hope
   of discovering new materials.
  Certain combinations of materials result in discoveries, once a material is discovered it becomes a known material.
  Player has a set of variables for the space craft spec. They choose when to test the design. An iterative physical
   simulation determines the viability of the craft. A percentage of the materials used in the test craft are consumed
 The materials that can be discovered are generated randomly on game start by starting with four ideal materials and
  generating backwards to produce enough intermediate materials (game difficulty control, more = harder)

 Material generation:
  Start with four materials suitably chosen to save 1000 people given the star mass and distance from star
  Create an empty set of starting materials
  Create an empty set of allowed materials
  Generate a random material M1.
  Choose M2, such that Combine(a * M1, b * M2) = IdealFuel (a,b are randomly chosen combination ratios)
  Add IdealFuel to allowed materials, M1,M2 to starting materials
  Generate a random material or choose from starting materials, call it M3 (may want to bias this)
  Choose M4, such that Combine(a * M3, b * M4) = IdealMetal
  Add IdealMetal to allowed materials, M3,M4 to starting materials
  Repeat for IdealTech and IdealSheild
  while number of final materials < number to create
     Remove material M from the starting materials
     Choose from the starting materials or randomly generate a material N (bias as needed)
     Choose O such that Combine(a * N, b * O) = M
     Add M to the allowed materials, O and N to the starting materials

 Materials are introduced as 'ore' containing unknown elements. By reacting them with known elements
  the properties can be determined (Players start with some known elements). E.g. if you start with NaCl
  and react it with Blah Ore (XY), to produce NaX YCl, you can then infer something about X and Y.

 At game start, star mass, and distance from star are not known. These must be researched in order to 
  determine required ship specs.

 Game intro start with a message from a solar observatory saying "Feck, Star's a gonner.." (to that effect)

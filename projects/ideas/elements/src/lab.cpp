	// Explanation of the physics of electron attractivity:
	// It all has to do with how much positive charge from the nucleus the electrons in the outer shell experience (which is usually called Z-effective or Zeff),
	// which depends on the principle quantum numbers of the electrons involved. The octet rule occurs mainly because an electron around a nucleus will not perfectly
	// "shield" another electron from the nucleus's positive charge, especially if the shielding electron and the incoming electron have the same principle quantum number.
	// 2p electrons can't shield other 2p electrons very well (and 3p can't shield other 3p very well, etc.). It's kind of complicated, but I will explain it as best I can.
	// Consider a helium atom and a hyrogen atom (a proton). If I only give my He atom one electron and give my proton no electrons, both my He and my proton will have a charge
	// of +1. Since they have the same charge, you might think that an electron would be equally attracted to either one - but that's not the case. An electron is much more
	// strongly attracted to an He+ atom than to a H+ atom. This occurs because even though the He+ and the H+ have the same charge, the He has two protons and the electron
	// that's already present won't perfectly shield the incoming electron from one whole unit of positive charge. The result is that an electron coming into an He+ atom will
	// experience a positive charge that's something like +1.3 insted of just +1. How well an electron shields an outer electron from the nucleus depends on the principle
	// quantum number and angular momentum quantum number of the electrons involved. If an electron has the same n and l value as the electron that it's trying to shield,
	// it won't be able to shield very well.
	// Consider a neutral carbon atom: it has 6 protons and 6 electrons (2 1s electrons, 2 2s electrons, and 2 2p electrons). If I add a new electron to make a C- anion,
	// the new electron that I'm adding will think that the atom has a charge of around +0.6 because each of the 2p electrons that are already there can only shield another
	// 2p electron from about .7 units of charge. But if I want to add an electron to a F atom to make F-, now my additional electron will see a charge of something like +1.5,
	// since there are already 5 2p electrons present that each allow +0.3 charge to "bleed through" their coverage of the nucleus. If I want to add another electron to my F-,
	// now I will have to add a 3s electron, and the 2p electrons that are already there will shield the 3s electron much better than they can shield other 2p electrons. So the
	// first extra electron that you add to F will see a charge of around +1.5, while the second will see a charge close to -1.
	// That is the main reason why atoms are more stable if they can get to 8 electrons to make an octet; so long as you are filling up a partly-filled p orbital, positive charge
	// from the nucleus will be able to get through to attract the extra electrons. Once you have filled the p orbital completely, you now have to add to the next level s orbital,
	// to which very little extra charge from the nucleus can get through. There are also a few issues with electrons being lower in energy if there are a lot of other electrons
	// around with the same n, l, and Ms values that contribute to the octet rule, but it mainly has to do with charge and charge shielding.
	// For simplicity, assume full valence shells shield 100% of the charge, valence electrons shield 60%

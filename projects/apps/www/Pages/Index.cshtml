    <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to Rylogic</h1>
    <p class="main-blurb">
        Rylogic is all about turning creative ideas into functional software.
        As a lone developer, there are a variety of unique (and somewhat unrelated)
        applications here. Most were designed to solve a specific problem I was facing
        at some point in time. Have a look around, and try out some of the applications.

                <p class="one-liner-description">
                    3D Visualisation aid based on scenes described using scripts.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    This is a more powerful tool than you might expect. Especially for debugging
                    collision detection in game physics engines! The script syntax is fairly simple
                    and can be spat out as debug output to a file. You can then view the scene from
                    any angle, perfect for visualization and animation projects.

                    Tool for viewing/searching extremely large log files.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    This was a tool a developed back in the early days of Android development, before there
                    were decent tools for viewing logcat. The main strength of this tool is the highly configurable
                    filtering and highlighting as well as the ability to handle log files that are many gigabytes in size.

                    Based on the regular expression knowledge I gained from <i>RyLogViewer</i>, this vertical text aligning
                    extension is something I still use every day.

                    This is a simple app I developed for my own use when practicing chord voicing and improvisation.
                    It generates random keys and chords to practice over, along with an optional walking bass and piano
                    accompaniment.

Files in this directory are the source files for the documentation html files.
These '.htm' files are compiled into '.html' files by the 'post_build.py' script
which copies them directly to the target directory.

In the project file they should have:
 "Build Action = None"
 "Copy to Output Directory = Do Not Copy"

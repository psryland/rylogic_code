				</li>
				<li id="file_scroll">
					<div class="section_title">File Scroll Indicator</div>
					<div class="content">
						The file scroll indicator serves two purposes. Primarily, it shows where the currently displayed data is
						located within the log file as a whole. Secondarily, it is used to quickly navigate to another location
						within the file.<br/>
						<br/>
						The different colours within the file scroll indicator convey the following information. These are the
						default colours, however the file scroll indicator colours can be changed in the
						<a href="options_appearance.html#appearance_cached_colour">options dialog</a>.
						<ul class="minor_list">
							<li><span style="background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:3px">white</span> - the regions of the log data not currently loaded into memory. This only occurs for large log files that cannot be fully cached in memory.</li>
							<li><span style="background-color:#d9e7ec;padding:3px">pale blue</span> - the portion of the log data that is cached in memory.</li>
							<li><span style="background-color:#adcbdd;padding:3px">light blue</span> - the portion of the file that is currently visible in the main window.</li>
							<li><span style="background-color:#589d6b;padding:3px">green</span> - the selected rows.</li>
							<li><span style="background-color:#dbaeee;padding:3px">light purple</span> - the bookmark locations.</li>
						</ul>
						Left clicking within the file scroll indicator selects the line at the corresponding position in the
						log file.<br/>
						<br/>
						Note: When a small log file is loaded you may wonder why the selection indication on the file scroll
						indicator changes size as different lines are selected. This is because the indicator represents the byte
						range of the selected line within the file, longer lines correspond to larger byte ranges and therefore
						a larger selection indicator.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li id="encoding">
					<div class="section_title">Text Encoding</div>
					<div class="content">
						RyLogViewer supports four common text encodings; ASCII, UTF-8, UCS-2 little-endian, and UCS-2 big-endian.
						The text encoding to use can be set under the <i>Encoding</i> menu. RyLogViewer supports automatic detection
						of the file text encoding, however, so it is usually not necessary to set the text encoding explicitly.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li id="line_ending">
					<div class="section_title">Line Endings</div>
					<div class="content">
						There are three line ending conventions in common use today:
						<ul class="minor_list">
							<li>Windows/DOS - carriage return, line feed character pairs,</li>
							<li>Unix - single line feed character,</li>
							<li>Macintosh - single carriage return character,</li>
						</ul>
						RyLogViewer supports all three conventions and is able to automatically detect the line ending style
						in most cases. There is also support for custom line ending sequences that allow arbitrary combinations
						of characters to be interpreted as a line ending. A <a href="options_general.html#line_ending">custom line ending</a>
						can be set in the options window which can be accessed quickly by selecting the <i>Custom</i>
						option under the <i>Line Ending</i> menu.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li id="search">
					<div class="section_title">Find Dialog / Searching</div>
					<div class="content">
						The ability to search for specific text within a log file is a vitally important feature. RyLogViewer
						is designed to make searching fast and simple, with convenient keyboard shortcuts that eliminate
						unnecessary switching between the mouse and keyboard. The following list details the shortcuts available:
						<ul class="minor_list">
							<li>Access the find dialog using the <span class="mono">Control+F</span> key combination.</li>
							<li>On opening, the search pattern combo box is selected so that a pattern can be entered immediately.</li>
							<li>The search pattern is initialised from the currently selected row in the log file.</li>
							<li>Use the down arrow key to show and select previous search patterns.</li>
							<li>
								Hit <span class="mono">Enter</span> to search forward from the currently selected line,<br/>
								<span class="mono">Control+Enter</span> searches forward from the beginning of the log file.
							</li>
							<li>
								Hit <span class="mono">Shift+Enter</span> to search backward from the currently selected line,<br/>
								<span class="mono">Control+Shift+Enter</span> searches backward from the end of the log file.
							</li>
							<li>Close the find dialog with the <span class="mono">Escape</span> key.</li>
						</ul>
						In the main log view, the following keyboard shortcuts are also available:
						<ul class="minor_list">
							<li><span class="mono">F3</span> - Search forward from the currently selected line using the last search pattern,</li>
							<li><span class="mono">Shift+F3</span> - Search backward from the currently selected line using the last search pattern,</li>
							<li>
								<span class="mono">Control+F3</span> - Set the search pattern to the contents of the currently selected line,
								and then search forward for the next occurrence.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="mono">Control+Shift+F3</span> - Set the search pattern to the contents of the currently selected line,
								and then search backward for the previous occurrence.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<img class="right_inset" src="../img/find.png" alt="find dialog"/>
						The find feature is based on the same algorithms as the other pattern matching features in RyLogViewer
						(<a href="options_highlighting.html">highlighting</a>, <a href="options_filtering.html">filtering</a>, etc).
						The controls function in the same way as described in the <a href="pattern_editor.html">pattern editor</a>
						section, otherwise:
						<ol class="minor_list">
							<li>Drop down list of previous search patterns.</li>
							<li>A list of previous search patterns.</li>
							<li>Find Next - searches forward from the currently selected line.</li>
							<li>Find Previous - searches backward from the currently selected line.</li>
							<li>Bookmark All - sets a bookmark on all lines that match the search pattern.</li>
						</ol>
						When a search reaches the start or end of the log file, a message is displayed in the
						<a href="main_window.html#status">Status bar</a> that indicates that the <i>Start of File</i>,
						or <i>End of File</i> has been reached.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li id="bookmarks">
					<div class="section_title">Bookmarks</div>
					<div class="content">
						Bookmarks provide a means of saving and returning to particular locations in the log file. Like the Find
						feature, convenient keyboard shortcuts are available to eliminate unnecessary switching between the mouse
						and keyboard.
						<ul class="minor_list">
							<li><span class="mono">Control+F2</span> - Creates or clears a bookmark from the currently selected line.</li>
							<li>
								<span class="mono">F2</span> - Jumps forward through the file to the next bookmark, looping around to the
								beginning of the file when the end of the file is reached.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="mono">Shift+F2</span> - Jumps backward through the file to the previous bookmark, looping
								around to the end of the file when the start of the file is reached.
							</li>
							<li>Access the bookmarks dialog using the <span class="mono">Control+B</span> key combination.</li>
						</ul>
						The bookmarks dialog is simply a list of saved bookmark positions. Selecting a bookmark in the list causes
						the main view to jump to the bookmarked position.
					</div>
				</li>
				<li id="status">
					<div class="section_title">Status</div>
					<div class="content">
						The status bar displays information about the currently loaded log file, as well as transient informational
						messages. From left to right, the status bar shows:
						<ul class="minor_list">
							<li>The byte offset of the currently selected line into the log file,</li>
							<li>The line ending mode being used to parse lines in the log file,</li>
							<li>The text encoding being used to read text from the log file,</li>
							<li>The file loading progress bar,</li>
							<li>A transient message describing the result of a recent operation.</li>
							<li>A static message describing the state of a running operation.</li>

					<div class="tag_label">Clear Log File</div>
					<div class="content">
						This option attempts to reset the contents of the loaded log file. It is not always possible

						(Typically, the application writing to the log file does this). When file locks permit this operation however,
						it can be a handy feature.

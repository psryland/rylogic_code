<Example log file for demonstrating the features of RyLogViewer>
<----------------------------------------------------------------->
The sections below quickly demonstrate each of the key features of
RyLogViewer. View this file in a text editor such as notepad to
compare its contents with how it is displayed in RyLogViewer.

<Highlighting>
Highlighting is a useful feature for making the important lines
in the log file stand out. An example would be to highlight lines
in the output of a program.
e.g.
	Error: this line contains an error message
	Warn: this line contains a warning message
	Info: this line contains general information
	Debug: this line contains debug output

<Filters>
Filtering allows lines to be specifically excluded or specifically included.
For example, in the lines below, filtering is used to remove all lines that
contain a Filter### line ending in an odd value, except for those ending with
a 5.
e.g.
	Filter001 - line 1
	Filter002 - line 2
	Filter003 - line 3
	Filter004 - line 4
	Filter005 - line 5
	Filter006 - line 6
	Filter007 - line 7
	Filter008 - line 8
	Filter009 - line 9
	Filter010 - line 10
	Filter011 - line 11
	Filter012 - line 12
	Filter013 - line 13
	Filter014 - line 14
	Filter015 - line 15
	Filter016 - line 16
	Filter017 - line 17
	Filter018 - line 18
	Filter019 - line 19
	Filter020 - line 20

<Transforms>
Transforms provide a way to re-format the log data. This can include swapping
parts of a line around, changing case, or substituting text based on a lookup
table. For example, the following lines map windows error codes to their string
equivalents:
	An error of type 0 occurred
	An error of type 1 occurred
	An error of type 2 occurred
	An error of type 3 occurred
	An error of type 4 occurred
	An error of type 5 occurred
	An error of type 6 occurred

<Actions>
Actions allow a program or batch file to be started by double clicking on a line
in the log file. For example, double clicking on the following line should launch
notepad with this file:
  example_logfile.txt

<Highlighting>
Highlighting is a useful feature for making the important lines
in the log file stand out. An example would be to highlight lines
in the log output of a program.
e.g.
	Error: this line contains an error message
	Warn: this line contains a warning message
	Info: this line contains general information
	Debug: this line contains debug output

<Filters>
Filtering allows lines to be specifically excluded or specifically included.
For example, in the lines below, filtering is used to remove all lines that
contain a Filter### line ending in an odd value, except for those ending with
a 5.
e.g.
	Filter001 - line 1
	Filter002 - line 2
	Filter003 - line 3
	Filter004 - line 4
	Filter005 - line 5
	Filter006 - line 6
	Filter007 - line 7
	Filter008 - line 8
	Filter009 - line 9
	Filter010 - line 10
	Filter011 - line 11
	Filter012 - line 12
	Filter013 - line 13
	Filter014 - line 14
	Filter015 - line 15
	Filter016 - line 16
	Filter017 - line 17
	Filter018 - line 18

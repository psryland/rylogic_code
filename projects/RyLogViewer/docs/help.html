			RylogViewer is designed to work with very large text files that are 
			changing dynamically. It continuously displays the file content, 
			updating as it changes similar to the Unix 'tail' command. 
			In addition, powerful pattern matching options allow highlighting, 
			filtering, text transformations, and custom actions. There is searching, 
			bookmarking, and support for common text encodings. RylogViewer can display 
			live program output, or data received over a serial port, TCP/UDP connection 
			or named pipe.

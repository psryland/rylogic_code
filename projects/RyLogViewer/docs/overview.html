					Many computer systems output log data in various forms. From servers logging connection events, to embedded
					systems streaming real-time state information, log output often contains vital diagnostic information.
					Frequently this vital information is hidden within large volumes of general output making finding, analysing,
					and diagnosing issues in the computer system a difficult and time consuming task. RyLogViewer was written to
					make working with high-volume log data easier.<br/>
					<br/>
					The simplest but probably most useful feature of RyLogViewer, is the ability to highlight lines in the log
					data based on some pattern, the canonical example being to have lines containing the word <i>error</i>
					appear with a red background.<br/>
					<br/>
					Patterns can be as simple as <i>"any line that contains the word 'error' "</i> to complex regular expressions.
					Once familiar with the pattern system, the same knowledge can be applied to search for specific text in the
					log data, create filters to strip out unwanted noise, transform and rearrange text into more meaningful/human-
					readable forms, and even setup actions to perform when double clicking on lines in the log data. (Check out
					the <a href="ideas.htm">ideas section</a> for inspiration on ways in which RyLogViewer can be used).<br/>
					<br/>
					RylogViewer is a shareware application, meaning there are limitations applied to the free version of the
					application that are removed in the licensed version. The primary aim of RyLogViewer however is to create
					an application that others might find useful, so for that reason, all features available in the licensed
					version are also available, indefinitely, in the free version. The only difference being that when a limit
					of the free version is exceeded a dialog is displayed explaining the limitation.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b style="color:#080">
						The free version of RyLogViewer can be used indefinitely and includes full support for
						all features available in the licensed version.<br/>

					The bullet points below give a summary of the main features and functionality of RyLogViewer, including
					links to further information in the remainder of the documentation.

				<ul>
					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Unlimited File Sizes</div>
							<div class="free_feature">Available in Free Edition</div>
							<div class="content">
								There is no upper limit on the size of displayed log files. RyLogViewer has been designed to
								intelligently spool and cache data dynamically, meaning that it runs as smoothly on a 200Gb
								file as it does on a 2Kb file.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Data Sources</div>
							<div class="free_feature">Available in Free Edition</div>
							<div class="content">
								In addition to displaying files from the local hard drive, RyLogViewer can receive
								and display real-time log output from a
								<a href="data_sources.htm#program_output">program's standard output</a>, from a
								<a href="data_sources.htm#serial_port">serial port connection</a>, via a
								<a href="data_sources.htm#tcpip">TCP/UDP network connection</a>, or from a
								<a href="data_sources.htm#named_pipe">named pipe</a>. Data received
								using these methods can be captured to a local file and saved for later viewing.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Highlighting</div>
							<div class="limited_feature">Limited in Free Edition</div>
							<div class="content">
								Important data in a log file can be made to stand out by creating a
								<a href="pattern_editor.htm">pattern</a> in the
								<a href="options_highlighting.htm">highlighting</a> options window. Highlighting can be
								quickly enabled or disabled via the <a href="main_window.htm#tool_bar">tool bar</a>. In the free
								version, highlighting is limited to
								<!--#value file="..\src\misc.cs" field="const int MaxHighlights\s+=\s+(?<field>\d+);"-->
								patterns, however more patterns can be used by selecting <i>enable</i> in the Free Edition
								Limited Feature dialog.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Aggregate Files</div>
							<div class="licensed_feature">Licensed feature</div>
							<div class="content">
								The aggregate files feature allows multiple files to be viewed as though they are a
								single file. All features (including highlighting, searching, filtering, etc) operate
								on the aggregate file in the same manor as they do for a single file.<br/>
								<br/>
								In addition, the <i>Export</i> function can by used to create a single amalgamated file
								that is the result of all of the files concatenated together after filtering and/or text
								transformations have been applied.<br/>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Android Logcat Viewer</div>
							<div class="free_feature">Available in Free Edition</div>
							<div class="content">
								One of the targeted uses for RyLogViewer is to aid Android application development. The
								Android operating system has a system wide logging feature that gives great insight into
								applications running on the device. The <a href="android_logcat.htm">Android Logcat Wizard</a>
								simplifies the process of connecting to this output log data
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Serial Port Logging</div>
							<div class="free_feature">Available in Free Edition</div>
							<div class="content">
								Embedded systems frequently use RS232 serial comms as a simple means of transmitting internal
								state to the outside world. RyLogViewer's serial port logging is ideally suited to this scenario
								as it can receive data directly from a serial port and capture it into a file. The highlighting
								feature can be used to make errors stand out, or state machine states/transitions obvious.
								The transforms feature can be used to replace error codes with meaningful error messages

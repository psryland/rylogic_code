				<div class="content">
					Many computer systems output log data in various forms. From servers logging connection events, to embedded
					systems streaming real-time state information, log output often contains vital diagnostic information.
					Frequently this vital information is hidden within large volumes of general output making finding, analysing,
					and diagnosing issues in the computer system a difficult and time consuming task. RyLogViewer was written to
					make working with high-volume log data easier.<br/>
					<br/>
					The simplest but probably most useful feature of RyLogViewer, is the ability to highlight lines in the log
					data based on some pattern, the canonical example being to have lines containing the word <i>error</i>
					appear with a red background.<br/>
					<br/>
					Patterns can be as simple as <i>"any line that contains the word 'error' "</i> to complex regular expressions.
					Once familiar with the pattern system, the same knowledge can be applied to search for specific text in the
					log data, create filters to strip out unwanted noise, transform and rearrange text into more meaningful/human-
					readable forms, and even setup actions to perform when double clicking on lines in the log data. (Check out
					the <a href="ideas.htm">ideas section</a> for inspiration on ways in which RyLogViewer can be used).<br/>
					<br/>
					RylogViewer is a shareware application, meaning there are limits applied to the free version of the
					application that are removed in the licensed version. However, these limits do not restrict or disable any
					of the functionally of the application. The free version merely prompts the user when a limit is exceeded
					giving the user the option to enable the licensed feature. After <!--#value name="FeatureEnableTime"-->
					minutes, the prompt will reappear.
					<b style="font-size:15px; color: #080">There is no time restriction or limit on the number of times licensed features can be enabled.</b><br/>
					<br/>
					The bullet points below give a summary of the main features and functionality of RyLogViewer, including
					links to further information in the remainder of the documentation.

				<ul>
					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Unlimited File Sizes</div>
							<div class="content">
								There is no upper limit on the size of displayed log files. RyLogViewer has been designed to
								intelligently spool and cache data dynamically, meaning that it runs as smoothly on a 200Gb
								file as it does on a 2Kb file.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Highlighting</div>
							<div class="limited_feature">Limited in Free Edition</div>
							<div class="content">
								Important data in a log file can be made to stand out by creating a
								<a href="pattern_editor.htm">pattern</a> in the
								<a href="options_highlighting.htm">highlighting</a> options window. Highlighting can be
								quickly enabled or disabled via the <a href="main_window.htm#tool_bar">tool bar</a>. In the free
								version, highlighting is limited to <!--#value name="MaxHighlights"-->
								patterns, however more patterns can be used by selecting <i>enable</i> in the Free Edition
								Limited Feature dialog.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Filtering</div>
							<div class="limited_feature">Limited in Free Edition</div>
							<div class="content">
								<a href="pattern_editor.htm">Patterns</a> can be created in the
								<a href="options_filtering.htm">filtering</a> options window to strip unwanted data from the log.
								Filtering can be quickly enabled or disabled via the <a href="main_window.htm#tool_bar">tool bar</a>.
								In the free version, filtering is limited to <!--#value name="MaxFilters"-->
								patterns, however more patterns can be used by selecting <i>enable</i> in the Free Edition
								Limited Feature dialog.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Transformations</div>
							<div class="limited_feature">Limited in Free Edition</div>
							<div class="content">
								<a href="options_transforms.htm">Transformations</a> are used to reformat the text that is
								displayed in the log. A <a href="pattern_editor.htm">pattern</a> is used to match lines in the
								log that are then substituted with the <i>Replace</i> template. Transforms are very flexible
								allowing reordering of text, changes in case, "swizzling" of characters, and error code lookup
								and substitution. Transforms can be quickly enabled or disabled via
								<a href="main_window.htm#tool_bar">tool bar</a>. In the free version, transforms are limited to
								<!--#value name="MaxTransforms"--> patterns, however more patterns can be used by selecting
								<i>enable</i> in the Free Edition Limited Feature dialog.

						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Actions</div>
							<div class="limited_feature">Limited in Free Edition</div>
							<div class="content">
								<a href="options_actions.htm">Actions</a> allow custom behaviour to be executed when a particular
								line in the log file is double clicked. For example, a <a href="pattern_editor.htm">pattern</a>
								that matches a file path and line number can be associated with an action that opens the file at
								the given line number in a text editor, a useful feature when viewing application debug output.
								In the free version, actions are limited to <!--#value name="MaxActions"-->
								patterns, however more patterns can be used by selecting <i>enable</i> in the Free Edition
								Limited Feature dialog.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Scratch Pad for Pattern Testing</div>
							<div class="content">
								The patterns that are at the core of many of the features in RyLogViewer can become very complex.
								To aid in ensuring a pattern behaves correctly, the <a href="pattern_editor.htm">pattern editor</a>
								features a <a href="pattern_editor.htm#test_area">test area</a> that allows the behaviour of a
								pattern to be previewed. This test area is a useful tool for learning regular expression syntax.

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Aggregate Files</div>
							<div class="licensed_feature">Licensed feature</div>
							<div class="content">
								The <a href="aggregate_files.htm">aggregate files</a> feature allows multiple files to be
								viewed as though they are a single file. All features (including highlighting, searching,
								filtering, etc) operate on the aggregate file in the same manor as they do for a single file.
								This is particularly useful for systems that produce sequentially numbered log files.<br/>
								<br/>
								In addition, the <a href="export.htm">Export</a> function can by used to create a single
								amalgamated file that is the result of all of the files concatenated together after filtering
								and/or text transformations have been applied.<br/>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Android Logcat output</div>
							<div class="content">
								One of the targeted uses for RyLogViewer is to aid Android application development. The
								Android operating system has a system wide logging feature that gives great insight into the
								applications running on the device. The <a href="android_logcat.htm">Android Logcat Wizard</a>
								simplifies the process of connecting and capturing this logcat data.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Program Output Logging</div>
							<div class="content">
								The <a href="data_sources.htm#program_output">Log Program Output</a> dialog can be used to
								launch another application and capture its standard output or standard error.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Serial Port Logging</div>
							<div class="content">
								Embedded systems frequently use RS232 serial comms as a simple means of transmitting internal
								state to the outside world. RyLogViewer's
								<a href="data_sources.htm#serial_port">serial port logging</a> is ideally suited to this scenario
								as it can receive data directly from a serial port and capture it into a file. Highlighting
								can then be used to make errors stand out, or state machine states/transitions obvious.
								The transforms feature can be used to replace error codes with meaningful error messages.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">TCP/UDP Network Connection Logging</div>
							<div class="content">
								The <a href="data_sources.htm#tcpip">Log Network Connection</a> dialog allows the capture
								of log data streamed over a network using either TCP or UDP protocols. The connection can be
								direct or via a proxy server.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Named Pipe Logging</div>
							<div class="content">
								Named pipes are a common form of inter-process communication. Writing log output to a named
								pipe is another method of getting log data out of an application or server. The
								<a href="data_sources.htm#named_pipe">Log Pipe Connection</a> dialog allows RyLogViewer to
								connect directly to the named pipe and capture any output received.
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li class="child_list_elem">
						<div>
							<div class="tag_label">Export</div>
							<div class="content">
								The <a href="export.htm">Export</a> option, under the file menu, writes the current log data
								to a file applying all enabled filters and transforms. Exporting is therefore a flexible way
								to transform a file and save the result. Exporting can also be performed by running RyLogViewer
								from the <a href="command_line.htm">command line</a> which allows RyLogViewer to be useful in
								batch scripts.

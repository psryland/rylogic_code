						RyLogViewer is typically installed via the application installer MSI file.

						RyLogViewer has been designed to support running from a removable drive. For
						this style of use, simply copy the 'RyLogViewer' directory to a removable/USB
						drive and create an empty file named <i>portable</i> (with no file extension)
						in the same directory as <i>RyLogViewer.exe</i>
						<br/>
						<br />
						On startup, RyLogViewer looks for the <i>portable</i> file in the same
						directory as the application executable. If found, the application starts in
						portable mode. Settings are loaded and saved to the same directory as the
						application. Alternatively, RyLogViewer can also be started in portable mode
						using the <i>-p</i> <a href="command_line.html">command line</a> switch.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<i>Note:</i> To run RyLogViewer in portable mode (such as from a USB drive),
						the host system must have the .NET Framework 4.5.2 re-distributable package
						installed. This is typically already installed on most windows computers,
						however if needed, it can be downloaded from:<br/>

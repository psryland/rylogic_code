				<div class="faq_question">Other programs using adb.exe disconnect when running RyLogViewer</div>
				<div class="faq_answer">
					Check whether you have more than one instance of adb.exe installed on your system and verify
					that RyLogViewer is running the same version of adb.exe as the other program.
					Running different versions of adb.exe can cause the ADB service to reset which is usually
					the cause of existing adb.exe instances disconnecting.<br/>
					<br/>
					To find out which version of adb.exe RyLogViewer is running, open the <a href="android_logcat.htm#adb_full_path">Android Logcat</a> wizard.<br/>
					<br/>
					RyLogViewer's use of adb.exe is no different to running adb.exe from a command prompt, so to
					help diagnose issues like this, trying running adb.exe from a command prompt window.

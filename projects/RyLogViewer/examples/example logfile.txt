# EXAMPLE LOG FILE FOR DEMONSTRATING THE FEATURES OF RYLOGVIEWER
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
The sections below quickly demonstrate each of the key features of
RyLogViewer. View this file in a text editor such as notepad to
compare its contents with how it is displayed in RyLogViewer.

# HIGHLIGHTING
Use highlighting to make important lines in the log file stand out.
e.g.
	Error: this line contains an error message
	Warn: this line contains a warning message
	Info: this line contains general information

# FILTERS
Use filtering to excluded unwanted lines.
e.g.
	#  Lines between here...
	## These lines will be
	## removed when filtering
	## is enabled
	#  ...and here were filtered

# TRANSFORMS
Transforms provide a way to re-format the log data. This can include swapping
parts of a line around, changing case, or substituting text based on a lookup
table. For example, the following lines map windows error codes to their string
equivalents:
	An error of type 0 occurred
	An error of type 1 occurred
	An error of type 2 occurred
	An error of type 3 occurred
	An error of type 4 occurred
	An error of type 5 occurred
	An error of type 6 occurred

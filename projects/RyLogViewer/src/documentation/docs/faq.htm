				<div class="faq_answer">
					Check the state of <i>Additive File Changes</i> mode. (The green 'plus' button on the toolbar).<br/>
					<img class="centred" src="img/tool_bar.png" alt="tool bar" />
					When enabled, RyLogViewer assumes that data will only ever be added to the viewed file and so any
					cached data it has will remain valid. This grealy improves performance for files or streamed data
					that are appended to only.<br/>
					<br/>
					However, if data in the file can be changed anywhere within the file, then <i>Additive File Changes</i>
					mode must be disabled. This will cause RyLogViewer to dump any cached data, ensuring correct file data
					is always displayed.<br/>
					<br/>
					A frequent cause of corrupted file data being displayed occurs when <i>Additive File Changes</i>
					mode is enabled, but the file has been changed in a way other than by appending data.

				<div class="faq_question">Other programs that use adb.exe disconnect when running RyLogViewer</div>
				<div class="faq_answer">
					Check whether you have more than one instance of adb.exe installed on your system and verify
					that RyLogViewer is running the same version of adb.exe as the other programs.
					Running different versions of adb.exe can cause the ADB service to reset which is usually
					the cause of existing adb.exe instances disconnecting.<br />
					<br />
					To find out which version of adb.exe RyLogViewer is running, open the <a href="android_logcat.html#adb_full_path">Android Logcat</a> wizard.<br />
					<br />
					RyLogViewer's use of adb.exe is no different to running adb.exe from a command prompt, so to
					help diagnose issues like this, try running adb.exe from a command prompt window.

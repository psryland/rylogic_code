RyLogViewer scans this directory for .NET 4.5.2 assemblies that implement
the extensible parts of the application. For more details on using and
creating plugins, see the help documentation.

As a quick guide, the steps you need to take to create a plugin
are as follows:

1) Create a .NET 4.5.2 class library project
2) Add references to:
    RyLogViewer.Extensions.dll
    Rylogic.dll
    (Found in the same directory that contains RyLogViewer.exe)
3) Create a class that implements 'RyLogViewer.ICustomLogDataSource' and mark it
   with the 'pr.common.PluginAttribute'. e.g.
       [pr.common.Plugin(typeof(ICustomLogDataSource))]
       public class MyCustomDataSource :ICustomLogDataSource
       {}
4) Build your project and put the resulting assembly in this "plugins" directory.
5) Restart RyLogViewer

If all was successful, your custom data source should appear as menu item under
the File->Data Sources menu. Inspect the ExamplePlugin project as a working example.

Notes:
  The C# files in the ".\examples\ReferenceSource" directory:
     ILogDataSource.cs
     IMainUI.cs
     ITransformSubstitution.cs
  are there for reference only, do not include them in your plugin project. They are
  built into the RyLogViewer.Extensions.dll and are available via that reference.
  They are intended as supplemental documentation to aid in plugin creation.

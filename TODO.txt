Immediate ToDo:
	
Work
  Change Review Board:
	- Remove product key - Fill in phase 1 - Documentation change
    - Text Zero Ref Data - Raise ticket - talk about it with china team
	- Zero Ref Tool - fill in phase 2 form - Ask pete if he is updating the 1550108 procedure
	
  Software Transfer meeting:
	Create a video about making movement maps
  
  Misc:
    - Change embedded script to use ram method of removing ROP
    - Fix the stupid 'bus_port-1' shit, use enum types 'device_bus_type_and_port_t', 'device_bus_type_t', and 'typedef int device_bus_port_t'
	- Sort out a new location for the MovementMap and Actuator Ref Data (.xml)
	    - Fix the default zero ref values and min/max extension in the actuator ref data
		- Back Hip beyond limit for movement: "Walk Fwd - Turning Left - Left Leg TO Right Leg (Flat)"
		- Back hip limits in released data are smaller than in .xml data
  
  Embedded:
    - Look at expanding the AC project to include real code
	
  MovementEditor:
    - Support editing
	- Optimise the dynamic linking in the map view
	
  RexTerminal:
	- Implement the session log viewer
	- Implement the battery log viewer
	- Push/pull zero ref values from REX
	
  UIv4:
    - Make Tunes an exported resource
	- Clean up rxs_AREX_...
	- Remove the zero-ref data from the 'actdata.cfg' file into its own file
	
  ZeroRef:
    - Test the ZR process on a left-right see-saw to see what effect that has on the results.
 	
  VRex:
    - Work out why the zero ref position is so different for VRex compared to REX
	- Add Leg Total lengths to VRex
	- Finish the p3d exporter and get the high-def Rex graphics back

  Log Viewer:
    - System for creating graphs of data in session logs
  
  RexLink:
    - Create a RexLink service and convert applications to use the service (solves the problem of multiple apps wanting to connect to the same Rex).
	
Rylogic:
  - Rewrite ClipX

  LDraw:
    - Drag and drop of non-ldr files is clunky
	- Camera type-in
	- Support LinkCamera
	- Drag and drop on Scene should not open the file, DnD on Script should. Handle large ldr files.
	- Add a skybox to the demo scene
	- Bug in Spline, missing last vertex
	- WASD camera controls
	- Equation doesn't renderer until first refresh
	- *Mesh should silently handle empty objects
	- Support sub models in object manager
	- Rendering bug in demo scene (looks like a depth state is not being set each frame. Ribbon rendering through rabbit, but not after toggling visibility. Rabbit is occluding other alphas)
	- Allow #include of temporary scripts
	
  P3D:
	- Finish exporter for Blender
	- Export REX models in new format
	- Export Plane model
	- Get p3d support working with new format
	- Support .obj files
		
  DockContainer:
	- Allow more than one floating window (i.e. float 2, then try to float one from the already floating window)

  View3d:
	- Add a dashed line pixel shader. (Each vertex has a parametric value, parametric value is
	  interpolated for the PS pixels. Use 'if (step(sin(pixel.parametric), 0.5)) clip'. GS will need to
	  pass the parametric value through)

  Physics:
	- debug the ClosestPoint_LineSegmentToBBox
	- Update the collision shapes and detection functions in pr/collision/
	- meta code for EShape to Shape type
	- SupportVertex
	- SupportFeature
	- Integrator
	- Spatial vector/matrices

  CoinFlip:
	Candle Charts:
		- Add measure tool to charts
	Equity Plot:
		- Show 'hodls' in equity plot
		- Auto range equity chart
		- Add price scenarios to the equity grid (dialog with sliders for each currency)
	Indicators:
		- Fib
		- Free draw line indicator
		- TD sequential
	Bots:
	General:
		- Fix up chart CMenu
		- Shade the price axis background based on the bullish/bearish-ness of the position with price at those levels (include pending orders)
		- Figure out how to isolate the monitored orders between back testing and live mode
		- Add spot price support to Poloniex and Bittrex
		- Variable spread for backtesting
		- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
		- Support minimise to tray
		- Better back testing playback controls: sub step count, playback speed, pause with space bar
	
  EDTradeAdvisor:
	- Settings UI
	- History of origins 
	- Swap Origin<->Destination button
	- Allow typing into station field with no system, to find system

  WinGUI:
	- OpenFolderUI
	- Fix MsgBox icon not having a transparent background
		
  Misc:
    - Reimplement HashCT functions as iterative now that C++20 is supported
	- Reimplement FFT code
	- Sort out pdbs for native libraries
	- Create a 'Dispatcher' in C++ using a HWND_MESSAGE window (see pr::Renderer)
	- Implement pr::script in C#
	- Better handling of native Settings
	- Change ToolForm to have resizable but not NC border

YouTube speed:
   vid = document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream html5-main-video")[0];
   vid.playbackRate=3.0;

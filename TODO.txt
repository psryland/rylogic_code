Immediate ToDo:

Cryptopia
	Questions:
		- Bug? GetTransactions uses a block hash as the parameter when talking to bitcoin, but uses the block index (height) when talking to Ethereum?!
		- How does Cryptopia manage it's wallet nodes? Which nodes are run locally? What are the addresses?
		  What test-nets
		- Some of the methods on 'WalletConnector' are not supported in Proxtopia
		  e.g. 'GetTxFee', 'GetBlockCount'. Are these just legacy functions that are no longer used?
		- The NodeJS implementation dumps all transactions to the log (i.e. 1000s of lines of text)
		  Does this effect the performance on the live system? or is it debug only?
		- What does ConsolidateAccounts do? When/how is it used?
		- Where are all the other coins handled? Proxtopia only has 17 'interface's?
		- What's the 'Proxtopia' folder in the 'Exchange' solution? It seems to contain wallet interfaces but different ones than in the Proxtopia project (except for Eth which is in both?)
		- Bitcoin has marked accounts within wallets as deprecated. Does that effect Cryptopia?
		- What happens if filling an order results in a remainder less than the minimum trade volume
		  (in either order). Can it happen?

	Wish List:
		- Broadcast data connection rather than polling
		- Provide chart "candle" data with per-tick updates
		- Historic trades contain the UID of the trade when it was live => to confirm order filled vs. order cancelled.
		- Trades filled immediately should still return a valid order id, so that can be matched in the history.
		- Units on the trade history columns

CoinFlip
	- determine equity in backwards from current balance
	- pending orders (Stop, OneEnablesOther, )
	- Make orders glow when hovered
	- Add more graphics to the positions, so they look better
	- saving/loading history to/from db
	- equity plotting
	- highlight selected positions on graph
	- remove old positions from charts	
	- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
	- Add S&R lines + other drawing tools
	- Add pending orders
	- Line indicators
	- Fishing - volume based position adjust
	- Equity graph
	- retest Fishing bottom
	- retest Loop finder
	- MOAR indicators
	- Equity graph for live account

	Strategy:
		- Have a budget; B BTC, and a a bias; O
		- Make holding of BTC above or below budget based on std dev from mean, where 1 s.d. == O BTC
		- Hysterisis when adjusting position
		
LDraw
	- move ObjectManager to pr.view3d
	- Auto complete in scripts
	- Make dock container tabs share the same row when top/bottom left/right tabs meet.
	- Improve log UI
	- shift+ctrl jumps back to the start of orientation, make it not do that
	- Add *Curve, a system for plotting 1D,2D functions of X, Y, or Z


RCT/RST
	- Setup VREX to reply with incorrect sizes message, see why there isn't a log message about corruption
	- UI to move config between regions (needs an enhancement ticket)
	- Make reference data filepaths support relative or 'working directory' relative, so that moving configs up and down directories doesn't break file links? (doesn't work for non-repo configs)
	- Save sets of logon data (url, working dir, user, pass) associated with a url
	- System for creating graphs of data in session logs
			
RexLink
	- Add stats for comms errors

RAPT

VRex
	- Add a pre-start up check for the SD card files that Rex needs and warn the user if missing
	- Fix devices going offline
	- Fix assert_param macro - threading issues
	- Add named-pipe RexLink connection type

	
Physics
	- debug the ClosestPoint_LineSegmentToBBox
	- Update the collision shapes and detection functions in pr/collision/
	- meta code for EShape to Shape type
	- SupportVertex
	- SupportFeature
	- Integrator
	- Spatial vector/matrices
	
WinGUI
	- OpenFolderUI
	- Fix MsgBox icon not having a transparent background
		
Misc
	- Merge View3d into the Renderer11 project
	- Create a 'Dispatcher' in C++ using a HWND_MESSAGE window (see pr::Renderer)
	- Implement pr::script in C#
	- Better handling of native Settings
	- Change ToolForm to have resizable but not NC border
	- Write a C# version of clicket that is more heuristical, ie.
		Find window:
			Constraint: title = "My Window"
			Constraint: size > 100,100 && size < 300,300
		Find Child Window:
			Constraint: text = "OK"
			Constraint: type (i.e class name contains) = "button"
		Action:
			Mouse left click.
			Type keys
	- Create a program that continually builds and runs a C++ file displaying the output

VS Extension - Align
 - stop at comment lines
 - Levistein distance rows (or maybe just use row 'form's)

Add outline code only to VS Extension

collect windowsfunctions.h into a better logical place

Immediate ToDo:

CoinFlip
	- Heikin-Ashi candle mode
	- TD sequential
	- Show 'hodls' in equity plot
	- Auto range equity chart
	- History is broken
	- Change the equity chart to have constant spacing between trades

	- Add price scenarios to the equity grid (dialog with sliders for each currency)
	- Support create trade at market price (so that it always fills)
	- Do something so that all pairs are not queried for history all the time on startup
	- Figure out how to isolate the monitored orders between back testing and live mode
	- Add spot price support to Poloniex and Bittrex
	- Variable spread for backtesting
	- pending orders (Stop, OneEnablesOther, )
	- saving/loading history to/from db
	- highlight selected positions on graph
	- remove old positions from charts	
	- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
	- Add pending orders
	- MOAR indicators
	- Free draw line indicator
	- Consider an arbitrage loop between BTC/USDT/USDC (check it for profitability)
	- Create an indicators panel (like trading view) that makes adding/accessing indicators easier
	
EDTradeAdvisor
	- ED Style
	- Settings UI
	- History of origin's 
	- Swap Origin<->Destination button
	- Allow typing into station field with no system, to find system
	
		
LDraw
	- move ObjectManager to pr.view3d
	- Auto complete in scripts
	- Make dock container tabs share the same row when top/bottom left/right tabs meet.
	- Improve log UI
	- shift+ctrl jumps back to the start of orientation, make it not do that
	- Add *Curve, a system for plotting 1D,2D functions of X, Y, or Z


RCT/RST
	- Setup VREX to reply with incorrect sizes message, see why there isn't a log message about corruption
	- UI to move config between regions (needs an enhancement ticket)
	- Make reference data filepaths support relative or 'working directory' relative, so that moving configs up and down directories doesn't break file links? (doesn't work for non-repo configs)
	- Save sets of logon data (url, working dir, user, pass) associated with a url
	- System for creating graphs of data in session logs
			
RexLink
	- Add stats for comms errors

RAPT

VRex
	- Fix devices going offline
	- Fix assert_param macro - threading issues
	- Add named-pipe RexLink connection type

	
Physics
	- debug the ClosestPoint_LineSegmentToBBox
	- Update the collision shapes and detection functions in pr/collision/
	- meta code for EShape to Shape type
	- SupportVertex
	- SupportFeature
	- Integrator
	- Spatial vector/matrices
	
WinGUI
	- OpenFolderUI
	- Fix MsgBox icon not having a transparent background
		
Misc
	- Merge View3d into the Renderer11 project
	- Create a 'Dispatcher' in C++ using a HWND_MESSAGE window (see pr::Renderer)
	- Implement pr::script in C#
	- Better handling of native Settings
	- Change ToolForm to have resizable but not NC border
	- Write a C# version of clicket that is more heuristical, ie.
		Find window:
			Constraint: title = "My Window"
			Constraint: size > 100,100 && size < 300,300
		Find Child Window:
			Constraint: text = "OK"
			Constraint: type (i.e class name contains) = "button"
		Action:
			Mouse left click.
			Type keys
	- Create a program that continually builds and runs a C++ file displaying the output

VS Extension - Align
 - stop at comment lines
 - Levistein distance rows (or maybe just use row 'form's)

Add outline code only to VS Extension

collect windowsfunctions.h into a better logical place

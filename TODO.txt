Immediate ToDo:

Work:
  Change Review Board:
	- Remove product key - Documentation change
	- Text Zero Ref Data - Raise ticket - talk about it with china team
	- Zero Ref Tool - fill in phase 2 form - awaiting signatures - then can be released and people notified.
	- Release the RexTerminal
	- rxsfault.log ticket
	- Add a requirement/test case that REX faults when the log SD card is full

  Misc:
	- Change embedded script to use ram method of removing ROP
	- Fix the stupid 'bus_port-1' shit, use enum types 'device_bus_type_and_port_t', 'device_bus_type_t', and 'typedef int device_bus_port_t'
	- Sort out a new location for the MovementMap and Actuator Ref Data (.xml)
		- Fix the default zero ref values and min/max extension in the actuator ref data
		- Back Hip beyond limit for movement: "Walk Fwd - Turning Left - Left Leg TO Right Leg (Flat)"
		- Back hip limits in released data are smaller than in .xml data
  
  Embedded:
	- Make the EnableHV UI menu option more robust. If already 'RXS_BP_QueryEStopTestState_Normal', switch on HV immediately. Allow it to be turned off again, without leaving the menus.
	- Make sure EnableHV works in R&D mode with tilt sensing on.
	- Look at expanding the AC project to include real code

  MovementEditor:
	- Optimise the dynamic linking in the map view
	- Validation needs to check all recovery stance ids are in stance list
	
  RexTerminal:
	- Create Firmware Versions tab - move 'update rtc' to the new tab
	- System for creating graphs of data in session logs
	- Push/pull zero ref values from REX
	- Support simple serial connections in Terminal
	
  FirmwareLoader:
	- Add support for the AS uploader (when its an official device) to allowing programming AS without JTAG
	- Add support for programming the Battery controller board.
	
  UIv4:
	- Make Tunes an exported resource
	- Clean up rxs_AREX_...
	- Remove the zero-ref data from the 'actdata.cfg' file into its own file
	
  ZeroRef:
    - Test the ZR process on a left-right see-saw to see what effect that has on the results.
 	
  VRex:
	- log doesn't work if logs folder is missing
	- Work out why the zero ref position is so different for VRex compared to REX
	- Add Leg Total lengths to VRex
	- Finish the p3d exporter and get the high-def Rex graphics back
	
  Physics:
	- Move step functionality from Emulation into Environment
	- Have the environment step the emulation and the physics

  RexLink:
	- Create a RexLink service and convert applications to use the service (solves the problem of multiple   apps wanting to connect to the same Rex).

Rylogic:
  - Rewrite ClipX
  - pr::hash::Hash is too complicated, use less name overloading. ie. HashBytes, HashString, HashArray, etc

  View3d-12:
	- Make nugget m_shaders a smarter object that handles replacing shaders for the same step. E.g.  nug.m_shaders += {ERenderStep::RenderForward, shdr};
	- Getting the model generater working 
	- Implementing LdrObject into the view3d-12 lib
	- Implementing the view3d dll API
    - Getting view3d-12 test working with the Dll instead of the lib
	- Environment mapping
	- Shadow mapping
	- Diagnositic modes, show normals, points, etc.
	- Don't use dll/window and main/window... it's confusing
	- Remove locks on D3DDevice
	- Setup a D2DLock to access D2D interfaces (if needed)
	
  LDraw:
	- Support dae files
	- Support urdf files
	- Drag and drop of non-ldr files is clunky
	- Camera type-in
	- Support LinkCamera
	- Drag and drop on Scene should not open the file, DnD on Script should. Handle large ldr files.
	- Add a skybox to the demo scene
	- Bug in Spline, missing last vertex
	- WASD camera controls
	- Equation doesn't renderer until first refresh
	- *Mesh should silently handle empty objects
	- Support sub models in object manager
	- Rendering bug in demo scene (looks like a depth state is not being set each frame. Ribbon rendering through rabbit, but not after toggling visibility. Rabbit is occluding other alphas)
	- Allow #include of temporary scripts
	
  P3D:
	- Finish exporter for Blender
	- Export REX models in new format
	- Export Plane model
	- Get p3d support working with new format
	- Support .obj files
		
  DockContainer:
	- Allow more than one floating window (i.e. float 2, then try to float one from the already floating window)

  View3d:
	- Add a dashed line pixel shader. (Each vertex has a parametric value, parametric value is interpolated for the PS pixels. Use 'if (step(sin(pixel.parametric), 0.5)) clip'. GS will need to pass the parametric value through)

  Physics:
	- debug the ClosestPoint_LineSegmentToBBox
	- Update the collision shapes and detection functions in pr/collision/
	- meta code for EShape to Shape type
	- SupportVertex
	- SupportFeature
	- Integrator
	- Spatial vector/matrices

  CoinFlip:
	Candle Charts:
		- Add measure tool to charts
	Equity Plot:
		- Show 'hodls' in equity plot
		- Auto range equity chart
		- Add price scenarios to the equity grid (dialog with sliders for each currency)
	Indicators:
		- Fib
		- Free draw line indicator
		- TD sequential
	Bots:
	General:
		- Fix up chart CMenu
		- Shade the price axis background based on the bullish/bearish-ness of the position with price at those levels (include pending orders)
		- Figure out how to isolate the monitored orders between back testing and live mode
		- Add spot price support to Poloniex and Bittrex
		- Variable spread for backtesting
		- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
		- Support minimise to tray
		- Better back testing playback controls: sub step count, playback speed, pause with space bar
	
  EDTradeAdvisor:
	- Settings UI
	- History of origins 
	- Swap Origin<->Destination button
	- Allow typing into station field with no system, to find system

  WinGUI:
	- OpenFolderUI
	- Fix MsgBox icon not having a transparent background
		
  Misc:
    - Reimplement HashCT functions as iterative now that C++20 is supported
	- Reimplement FFT code
	- Sort out pdbs for native libraries
	- Create a 'Dispatcher' in C++ using a HWND_MESSAGE window (see pr::Renderer)
	- Implement pr::script in C#
	- Better handling of native Settings
	- Change ToolForm to have resizable but not NC border

YouTube speed:
   vid = document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream html5-main-video")[0];
   vid.playbackRate=3.0;

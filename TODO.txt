Immediate ToDo:
	
LDraw
	- Highlight errors in editor
	- Handle scriptUI files changing externally
	- Status bar shows pointer position when ActiveScene != null
	- Support line continuation for highlighting
	- Fix the measurement tool not detecting mouse clicks
	- Make dock container tabs share the same row when top/bottom left/right tabs meet.
	- shift+ctrl jumps back to the start of orientation, make it not do that
	- Add *Curve, a system for plotting 1D,2D functions of X, Y, or Z
	- Add support for streaming ldr script via TCP/IP (add *Clear command back)
	- Script parsing performance profiling
	- Finish implementing the preferences dialog
	- Installer
	
CoinFlip
	Candle Charts:
		- Add measure tool to charts
	Equity Plot:
		- Show 'hodls' in equity plot
		- Auto range equity chart
		- Add price scenarios to the equity grid (dialog with sliders for each currency)
	Indicators:
		- Fib
		- Free draw line indicator
		- TD sequential
	Bots:
	General:
		- Fix up chart CMenu
		- Shade the price axis background based on the bullish/bearish-ness of the position with price at those levels (include pending orders)
		- Figure out how to isolate the monitored orders between back testing and live mode
		- Add spot price support to Poloniex and Bittrex
		- Variable spread for backtesting
		- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
		- Support minimise to tray
		- Better back testing playback controls: sub step count, playback speed, pause with space bar
	
EDTradeAdvisor
	- Settings UI
	- History of origin's 
	- Swap Origin<->Destination button
	- Allow typing into station field with no system, to find system
	
		
RCT/RST
	- Setup VREX to reply with incorrect sizes message, see why there isn't a log message about corruption
	- UI to move config between regions (needs an enhancement ticket)
	- Make reference data filepaths support relative or 'working directory' relative, so that moving configs up and down directories doesn't break file links? (doesn't work for non-repo configs)
	- Save sets of logon data (url, working dir, user, pass) associated with a url
	- System for creating graphs of data in session logs

VRex
	- Fix devices going offline
	- Fix assert_param macro - threading issues
	- Add named-pipe RexLink connection type

	
Physics
	- debug the ClosestPoint_LineSegmentToBBox
	- Update the collision shapes and detection functions in pr/collision/
	- meta code for EShape to Shape type
	- SupportVertex
	- SupportFeature
	- Integrator
	- Spatial vector/matrices
	
Renderer/View3d
	- Add a dashed line pixel shader. (Each vertex has a parametric value, parametric value is
	  interpolated for the PS pixels. Use 'if (step(sin(pixel.parametric), 0.5)) clip'. GS will need to
	  pass the parametric value through)
	- Merge View3d into the Renderer11 project and make view3d.dll just a build configuration

DockContainer
	- Allow more than one floating window (i.e. float 2, then try to float one from the already floating window)
	
WinGUI
	- OpenFolderUI
	- Fix MsgBox icon not having a transparent background
		
Misc
	- Create a 'Dispatcher' in C++ using a HWND_MESSAGE window (see pr::Renderer)
	- Implement pr::script in C#
	- Better handling of native Settings
	- Change ToolForm to have resizable but not NC border

Old:
convert linedrawer all to wingui
ldr_object_dlg
measure tool
angle tool
Make Scintilla+Ldr support a dll
Implement a XElement-like tree reader/writer for pr-script
Make a regex tester for C++ std::regex
Implement Fmt() as a variadic template
Fix non-pod types in pr::vector<>
Fix crash in Diagram Control
VS Extension - Align
 - stop at comment lines
 - Levistein distance rows (or maybe just use row 'form's)
Add outline code only to VS Extension

   vid = document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream html5-main-video")[0];
   vid.playbackRate=3.0;

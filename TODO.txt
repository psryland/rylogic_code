Immediate ToDo:

EDTradeAdvisor
	- ED Style
	- Settings UI
	- History of origin's 
	- Swap Origin<->Destination button
	- Allow typing into station field with no system, to find system
	
CoinFlip
	- determine equity in backwards from current balance
	- pending orders (Stop, OneEnablesOther, )
	- Make orders glow when hovered
	- Add more graphics to the positions, so they look better
	- saving/loading history to/from db
	- equity plotting
	- highlight selected positions on graph
	- remove old positions from charts	
	- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
	- Add S&R lines + other drawing tools
	- Add pending orders
	- Line indicators
	- Fishing - volume based position adjust
	- Equity graph
	- retest Fishing bottom
	- retest Loop finder
	- MOAR indicators
	- Equity graph for live account

	Strategy:
		- Have a budget; B BTC, and a a bias; O
		- Make holding of BTC above or below budget based on std dev from mean, where 1 s.d. == O BTC
		- Hysteresis when adjusting position
		
LDraw
	- move ObjectManager to pr.view3d
	- Auto complete in scripts
	- Make dock container tabs share the same row when top/bottom left/right tabs meet.
	- Improve log UI
	- shift+ctrl jumps back to the start of orientation, make it not do that
	- Add *Curve, a system for plotting 1D,2D functions of X, Y, or Z


RCT/RST
	- Setup VREX to reply with incorrect sizes message, see why there isn't a log message about corruption
	- UI to move config between regions (needs an enhancement ticket)
	- Make reference data filepaths support relative or 'working directory' relative, so that moving configs up and down directories doesn't break file links? (doesn't work for non-repo configs)
	- Save sets of logon data (url, working dir, user, pass) associated with a url
	- System for creating graphs of data in session logs
			
RexLink
	- Add stats for comms errors

RAPT

VRex
	- Add a pre-start up check for the SD card files that Rex needs and warn the user if missing
	- Fix devices going offline
	- Fix assert_param macro - threading issues
	- Add named-pipe RexLink connection type

	
Physics
	- debug the ClosestPoint_LineSegmentToBBox
	- Update the collision shapes and detection functions in pr/collision/
	- meta code for EShape to Shape type
	- SupportVertex
	- SupportFeature
	- Integrator
	- Spatial vector/matrices
	
WinGUI
	- OpenFolderUI
	- Fix MsgBox icon not having a transparent background
		
Misc
	- Merge View3d into the Renderer11 project
	- Create a 'Dispatcher' in C++ using a HWND_MESSAGE window (see pr::Renderer)
	- Implement pr::script in C#
	- Better handling of native Settings
	- Change ToolForm to have resizable but not NC border
	- Write a C# version of clicket that is more heuristical, ie.
		Find window:
			Constraint: title = "My Window"
			Constraint: size > 100,100 && size < 300,300
		Find Child Window:
			Constraint: text = "OK"
			Constraint: type (i.e class name contains) = "button"
		Action:
			Mouse left click.
			Type keys
	- Create a program that continually builds and runs a C++ file displaying the output

Old:
convert linedrawer all to wingui
ldr_object_dlg
measure tool
angle tool

Implement pr::script in C#

Make Scintilla+Ldr support a dll

Implement a XElement-like tree reader/writer for pr-script

Make a regex tester for C++ std::regex

Implement Fmt() as a variadic template

Fix non-pod types in pr::vector<>
Fix crash in Diagram Control


VS Extension - Align
 - stop at comment lines
 - Levistein distance rows (or maybe just use row 'form's)

Add outline code only to VS Extension

collect windowsfunctions.h into a better logical place

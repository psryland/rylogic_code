Immediate ToDo:

Work
  Work:
	- Error prompt for 'libusb_open() failed with LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_FOUND' = install driver
	- Ask Duncan why Polarian isn't notifying Pete about customer services tickets any more
	- Sort out a new location for the MovementMap and Actuator Ref Data (.xml)
	    - Fix the default zero ref values and min/max extension in the actuator ref data
		- Back Hip beyond limit for movement: "Walk Fwd - Turning Left - Left Leg TO Right Leg (Flat)"
		- Back hip limits in released data are smaller than in .xml data
	- Need a way to generate complete SD cards again -> Do this in Build.py
	- Push/pull zero ref values from REX

  UIv4
	- Use DMA for clear and column blts
	- Get SD Card working
	- Check alignment of DMA'd buffers
	- Write a Polarian requirements sheet for the new UI
	- Clean up rxs_AREX_...
	- Remove the zero-ref data from the 'actdata.cfg' file into its own file
	- Replace Darcy's message queue implementation with a sane one
	
  ZeroRef
    - Add the rexnode_driver to the installer
	- Check for when the sensors are on the wrong side, safety. Set a 5mm bound on each actuator and error if it goes out of range.
 	
  VRex
    - Port the tools from the old VRex over
	- Fix ground plane
	- Add Leg Total lengths to VRex
	- Finish the p3d exporter and get the high-def Rex graphics back
	- Fix the console text (missing a character)
	
LDraw
	- Camera type-in
	- Support LinkCamera
	- Drag and drop on Scene should not open the file, DnD on Script should. Handle large ldr files.
	- Add a skybox to the demo scene
	- Bug in Spline, missing last vertex
	- WASD camera controls
	- Equation doesn't renderer until first refresh
	- *Mesh should silently handle empty objects
	- Support sub models in object manager
	- Rendering bug in demo scene (looks like a depth state is not being set each frame. Ribbon rendering through rabbit, but not after toggling visibility. Rabbit is occluding other alphas)
	- Allow #include of temporary scripts
	
P3D
	- Finish exporter for Blender
	- Export REX models in new format
	- Export Plane model
	- Get p3d support working with new format
	- Support .obj files
		
CoinFlip
	Candle Charts:
		- Add measure tool to charts
	Equity Plot:
		- Show 'hodls' in equity plot
		- Auto range equity chart
		- Add price scenarios to the equity grid (dialog with sliders for each currency)
	Indicators:
		- Fib
		- Free draw line indicator
		- TD sequential
	Bots:
	General:
		- Fix up chart CMenu
		- Shade the price axis background based on the bullish/bearish-ness of the position with price at those levels (include pending orders)
		- Figure out how to isolate the monitored orders between back testing and live mode
		- Add spot price support to Poloniex and Bittrex
		- Variable spread for backtesting
		- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
		- Support minimise to tray
		- Better back testing playback controls: sub step count, playback speed, pause with space bar
	
EDTradeAdvisor
	- Settings UI
	- History of origin's 
	- Swap Origin<->Destination button
	- Allow typing into station field with no system, to find system
	
		
RCT/RST
	- Setup VREX to reply with incorrect sizes message, see why there isn't a log message about corruption
	- UI to move config between regions (needs an enhancement ticket)
	- Make reference data filepaths support relative or 'working directory' relative, so that moving configs up and down directories doesn't break file links? (doesn't work for non-repo configs)
	- Save sets of logon data (url, working dir, user, pass) associated with a url
	- System for creating graphs of data in session logs

VRex
	- Add a quick way to put REX in one of the available stances
	- Fix devices going offline
	- Fix assert_param macro - threading issues
	- Add named-pipe RexLink connection type

	
Physics
	- debug the ClosestPoint_LineSegmentToBBox
	- Update the collision shapes and detection functions in pr/collision/
	- meta code for EShape to Shape type
	- SupportVertex
	- SupportFeature
	- Integrator
	- Spatial vector/matrices
	
Renderer/View3d
	- Add a dashed line pixel shader. (Each vertex has a parametric value, parametric value is
	  interpolated for the PS pixels. Use 'if (step(sin(pixel.parametric), 0.5)) clip'. GS will need to
	  pass the parametric value through)

DockContainer
	- Allow more than one floating window (i.e. float 2, then try to float one from the already floating window)
	
WinGUI
	- OpenFolderUI
	- Fix MsgBox icon not having a transparent background
		
Misc
	- Sort out pdb's for native libraries
	- Create a 'Dispatcher' in C++ using a HWND_MESSAGE window (see pr::Renderer)
	- Implement pr::script in C#
	- Better handling of native Settings
	- Change ToolForm to have resizable but not NC border


Old:
ldr_object_dlg
measure tool
angle tool
Make Scintilla+Ldr support a dll
Implement a XElement-like tree reader/writer for pr-script
Fix non-pod types in pr::vector<>

YouTube speed:
   vid = document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream html5-main-video")[0];
   vid.playbackRate=3.0;

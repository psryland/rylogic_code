Immediate ToDo:
	Sort out pdb's for native libraries
	Get p3d support working with new format
	Finish exporter for Blender
	Export REX models in new format
	Export Plane model
	
Work
  UIv4
	Set up sending drawlist in multiple parts
	Add 'Language' menu option and runtime support for switching
	Add 'Futurama' font
    Remove header 'typedefs_ui.h'
	Remove resource crc's, they're not needed.
	Clean up header 'manager_user_interface.h'
	Remove REX_USER_INTERFACE_V4
	Remove most of the old UserInterface API. Port code to new API
	Add string tables to the movement maps/RCT
	Animated sprites
	
  VRex
	- Fix ground plane
	- Add Leg Total lengths to VRex
	- Update build scripts for new projects
  Misc
	- Set up Git on the machine that runs plastic...
	
SolarHotWater
	- Auto scroll graph
	- Schedule control
	
LDraw
	- Camera type-in
	- Drag and drop on Scene should not open the file, DnD on Script should. Handle large ldr files.
	- Add a skybox to the demo scene
	- Bug in Spline, missing last vertex
	- WASD camera controls
	- Equation doesn't renderer until first refresh
	- *Mesh should silently handle empty objects
	- Support sub models in object manager
	- Rendering bug in demo scene (looks like a depth state is not being set each frame. Ribbon rendering through rabbit, but not after toggling visibility. Rabbit is occluding other alphas)
	- Allow #include of temporary scripts

TextAligner
	
P3D
	- Support .obj files
	
CoinFlip
	Candle Charts:
		- Add measure tool to charts
	Equity Plot:
		- Show 'hodls' in equity plot
		- Auto range equity chart
		- Add price scenarios to the equity grid (dialog with sliders for each currency)
	Indicators:
		- Fib
		- Free draw line indicator
		- TD sequential
	Bots:
	General:
		- Fix up chart CMenu
		- Shade the price axis background based on the bullish/bearish-ness of the position with price at those levels (include pending orders)
		- Figure out how to isolate the monitored orders between back testing and live mode
		- Add spot price support to Poloniex and Bittrex
		- Variable spread for backtesting
		- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
		- Support minimise to tray
		- Better back testing playback controls: sub step count, playback speed, pause with space bar
	
EDTradeAdvisor
	- Settings UI
	- History of origin's 
	- Swap Origin<->Destination button
	- Allow typing into station field with no system, to find system
	
		
RCT/RST
	- Setup VREX to reply with incorrect sizes message, see why there isn't a log message about corruption
	- UI to move config between regions (needs an enhancement ticket)
	- Make reference data filepaths support relative or 'working directory' relative, so that moving configs up and down directories doesn't break file links? (doesn't work for non-repo configs)
	- Save sets of logon data (url, working dir, user, pass) associated with a url
	- System for creating graphs of data in session logs

VRex
	- Add a quick way to put REX in one of the available stances
	- Fix devices going offline
	- Fix assert_param macro - threading issues
	- Add named-pipe RexLink connection type

	
Physics
	- debug the ClosestPoint_LineSegmentToBBox
	- Update the collision shapes and detection functions in pr/collision/
	- meta code for EShape to Shape type
	- SupportVertex
	- SupportFeature
	- Integrator
	- Spatial vector/matrices
	
Renderer/View3d
	- Add a dashed line pixel shader. (Each vertex has a parametric value, parametric value is
	  interpolated for the PS pixels. Use 'if (step(sin(pixel.parametric), 0.5)) clip'. GS will need to
	  pass the parametric value through)

DockContainer
	- Allow more than one floating window (i.e. float 2, then try to float one from the already floating window)
	
WinGUI
	- OpenFolderUI
	- Fix MsgBox icon not having a transparent background
		
Misc
	- Create a 'Dispatcher' in C++ using a HWND_MESSAGE window (see pr::Renderer)
	- Implement pr::script in C#
	- Better handling of native Settings
	- Change ToolForm to have resizable but not NC border

Old:
ldr_object_dlg
measure tool
angle tool
Make Scintilla+Ldr support a dll
Implement a XElement-like tree reader/writer for pr-script
Implement Fmt() as a variadic template
Fix non-pod types in pr::vector<>
Fix crash in Diagram Control
VS Extension - Align
 - stop at comment lines
 - Levistein distance rows (or maybe just use row 'form's)
Add outline code only to VS Extension

YouTube speed:
   vid = document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream html5-main-video")[0];
   vid.playbackRate=3.0;

Immediate ToDo:

CoinFlip
	Candle Charts:
		- Show remaining candle time
		- Add measure tool to charts
	Equity Plot:
		- Show 'hodls' in equity plot
		- Auto range equity chart
		- Add price scenarios to the equity grid (dialog with sliders for each currency)
	Indicators:
		- Free draw line indicator
		- TD sequential
	Bots:
		- Consider an arbitrage loop between BTC/USDT/USDC (check it for profitability)
	General:
		- Figure out how to isolate the monitored orders between back testing and live mode
		- Add spot price support to Poloniex and Bittrex
		- Variable spread for backtesting
		- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
		- Support minimise to tray
		- Better back testing playback controls: sub step count, playback speed, pause with space bar

RCT/RST
	- Setup VREX to reply with incorrect sizes message, see why there isn't a log message about corruption
	- UI to move config between regions (needs an enhancement ticket)
	- Make reference data filepaths support relative or 'working directory' relative, so that moving configs up and down directories doesn't break file links? (doesn't work for non-repo configs)
	- Save sets of logon data (url, working dir, user, pass) associated with a url
	- System for creating graphs of data in session logs

Misc
	- Merge View3d into the Renderer11 project

			Constraint: title = "My Window"
			Constraint: size > 100,100 && size < 300,300
		Find Child Window:
			Constraint: text = "OK"
			Constraint: type (i.e class name contains) = "button"
		Action:
			Mouse left click.
			Type keys
	- Create a program that continually builds and runs a C++ file displaying the output

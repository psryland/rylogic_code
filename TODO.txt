Immediate ToDo:

Work

  Misc:
    - Change embedded script to use ram method of removing ROP
    - Fix the fucking stupid 'bus_port-1' shit, use enum types 'device_bus_type_and_port_t', 'device_bus_type_t', and 'typedef int device_bus_port_t'
	- Remove the "shared" PSRAM implementation from drivers to MC and LC, since it isn't really shared at all
	- Sort out a new location for the MovementMap and Actuator Ref Data (.xml)
	    - Fix the default zero ref values and min/max extension in the actuator ref data
		- Back Hip beyond limit for movement: "Walk Fwd - Turning Left - Left Leg TO Right Leg (Flat)"
		- Back hip limits in released data are smaller than in .xml data
	- Need a way to generate complete SD cards again -> Do this in Build.py
	- Push/pull zero ref values from REX
	- Add to RXS console to display current state
	
  FirmwareLoader
	- Disable UI while programming
	- Error prompt for 'libusb_open() failed with LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_FOUND' = install driver

  RexTerm:
    - Make sure the control characters are passed through to the console (Ctrl-Z, etc)
	
  UIv4:
    - Implement the console
	- Come up with a test plan for the new UI based on the requirements (review with Stephanie)
    - Joystick twist sensitivity on mmode selection screen (better debouncing)
    - Fix backlight flash with different method
    - Make Tunes an exported resource
	- Write a Polarian requirements sheet for the new UI
	- Clean up rxs_AREX_...
	- Remove the zero-ref data from the 'actdata.cfg' file into its own file
	
  ZeroRef:
    - Test the ZR process on a left-right see-saw to see what effect that has on the results.
	- Check for when the sensors are on the wrong side, safety. Set a 5mm bound on each actuator and error if it goes out of range.
 	
  VRex:
    - Port the tools from the old VRex over
	- Fix ground plane
	- Add Leg Total lengths to VRex
	- Finish the p3d exporter and get the high-def Rex graphics back
	- Fix the console text (missing a character)
	- Add a quick way to put REX in one of the available stances
	- Fix devices going offline

  Log Viewer:
    - System for creating graphs of data in session logs
  
Rylogic:	
  LDraw:
	- Camera type-in
	- Support LinkCamera
	- Drag and drop on Scene should not open the file, DnD on Script should. Handle large ldr files.
	- Add a skybox to the demo scene
	- Bug in Spline, missing last vertex
	- WASD camera controls
	- Equation doesn't renderer until first refresh
	- *Mesh should silently handle empty objects
	- Support sub models in object manager
	- Rendering bug in demo scene (looks like a depth state is not being set each frame. Ribbon rendering through rabbit, but not after toggling visibility. Rabbit is occluding other alphas)
	- Allow #include of temporary scripts
	
  P3D:
	- Finish exporter for Blender
	- Export REX models in new format
	- Export Plane model
	- Get p3d support working with new format
	- Support .obj files
		
  DockContainer:
	- Allow more than one floating window (i.e. float 2, then try to float one from the already floating window)

  View3d:
	- Add a dashed line pixel shader. (Each vertex has a parametric value, parametric value is
	  interpolated for the PS pixels. Use 'if (step(sin(pixel.parametric), 0.5)) clip'. GS will need to
	  pass the parametric value through)

  Physics:
	- debug the ClosestPoint_LineSegmentToBBox
	- Update the collision shapes and detection functions in pr/collision/
	- meta code for EShape to Shape type
	- SupportVertex
	- SupportFeature
	- Integrator
	- Spatial vector/matrices

  CoinFlip:
	Candle Charts:
		- Add measure tool to charts
	Equity Plot:
		- Show 'hodls' in equity plot
		- Auto range equity chart
		- Add price scenarios to the equity grid (dialog with sliders for each currency)
	Indicators:
		- Fib
		- Free draw line indicator
		- TD sequential
	Bots:
	General:
		- Fix up chart CMenu
		- Shade the price axis background based on the bullish/bearish-ness of the position with price at those levels (include pending orders)
		- Figure out how to isolate the monitored orders between back testing and live mode
		- Add spot price support to Poloniex and Bittrex
		- Variable spread for backtesting
		- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
		- Support minimise to tray
		- Better back testing playback controls: sub step count, playback speed, pause with space bar
	
  EDTradeAdvisor:
	- Settings UI
	- History of origins 
	- Swap Origin<->Destination button
	- Allow typing into station field with no system, to find system

  WinGUI:
	- OpenFolderUI
	- Fix MsgBox icon not having a transparent background
		
  Misc:
	- Sort out pdbs for native libraries
	- Create a 'Dispatcher' in C++ using a HWND_MESSAGE window (see pr::Renderer)
	- Implement pr::script in C#
	- Better handling of native Settings
	- Change ToolForm to have resizable but not NC border

YouTube speed:
   vid = document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream html5-main-video")[0];
   vid.playbackRate=3.0;
   
WoW:
	- Spatial Realignment Appartus (Ve'nari)
	- Primal Tide Core
	
	
   L3tMe1n!

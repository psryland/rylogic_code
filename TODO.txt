	Finish exporter for Blender
	Export REX models in new format
	Export Plane model
	
Work
  \\10.0.10.85\Users\etienne.kilian\Desktop\ZRTDebug
  RexNode Sensor
	- Battery monitoring - low power warning.. show in console
	- MuRata to sleep between samples
  RexNode Dongle
    - Make the dongle code work with a boot loader
  ZRT
    - Make lines from bubbles go green as well
	- Make the 'bubbles' not always go to the far edge of the window
	
  VRex
	- Fix ground plane
	- Add Leg Total lengths to VRex
	- Update build scripts for new projects
  Misc
	- Set up Git on the machine that runs plastic...
	
SolarHotWater
	- Auto scroll graph
	- Schedule control
LDraw
	- Drag and drop on Scene should not open the file, DnD on Script should. Handle large ldr files.
	- Add a skybox to the demo scene
	- Bug in Spline, missing last vertex
	- Camera type-in
	- WASD camera controls
	- Equation doesn't renderer until first refresh
	- *Mesh should silently handle empty objects
	- Support sub models in object manager

TextAligner
	
P3D
	- Support .obj files
	
CoinFlip
	Candle Charts:
		- Add measure tool to charts
	Equity Plot:
		- Show 'hodls' in equity plot
		- Auto range equity chart
		- Add price scenarios to the equity grid (dialog with sliders for each currency)
	Indicators:
		- Fib
		- Free draw line indicator
		- TD sequential
	Bots:
	General:
		- Fix up chart CMenu
		- Shade the price axis background based on the bullish/bearish-ness of the position with price at those levels (include pending orders)
		- Figure out how to isolate the monitored orders between back testing and live mode
		- Add spot price support to Poloniex and Bittrex
		- Variable spread for backtesting
		- Log view isn't updating when window doesn't have focus
		- Support minimise to tray
		- Better back testing playback controls: sub step count, playback speed, pause with space bar
	
EDTradeAdvisor
	- Settings UI
	- History of origin's 
	- Swap Origin<->Destination button
	- Allow typing into station field with no system, to find system
	
		
RCT/RST
	- Setup VREX to reply with incorrect sizes message, see why there isn't a log message about corruption
	- UI to move config between regions (needs an enhancement ticket)
	- Make reference data filepaths support relative or 'working directory' relative, so that moving configs up and down directories doesn't break file links? (doesn't work for non-repo configs)
	- Save sets of logon data (url, working dir, user, pass) associated with a url
	- System for creating graphs of data in session logs

VRex
	- Add a quick way to put REX in one of the available stances
	- Fix devices going offline
	- Fix assert_param macro - threading issues
	- Add named-pipe RexLink connection type

	
Physics
	- debug the ClosestPoint_LineSegmentToBBox
	- Update the collision shapes and detection functions in pr/collision/
	- meta code for EShape to Shape type
	- SupportVertex
	- SupportFeature
	- Integrator
	- Spatial vector/matrices
	
Renderer/View3d
	- Add a dashed line pixel shader. (Each vertex has a parametric value, parametric value is
	  interpolated for the PS pixels. Use 'if (step(sin(pixel.parametric), 0.5)) clip'. GS will need to
	  pass the parametric value through)

DockContainer
	- Allow more than one floating window (i.e. float 2, then try to float one from the already floating window)
	
WinGUI
	- OpenFolderUI
	- Fix MsgBox icon not having a transparent background
		
Misc
	- Create a 'Dispatcher' in C++ using a HWND_MESSAGE window (see pr::Renderer)
	- Implement pr::script in C#
	- Better handling of native Settings
	- Change ToolForm to have resizable but not NC border

Old:
ldr_object_dlg
measure tool
angle tool
Make Scintilla+Ldr support a dll
Implement a XElement-like tree reader/writer for pr-script
Implement Fmt() as a variadic template
Fix non-pod types in pr::vector<>
Fix crash in Diagram Control
VS Extension - Align
 - stop at comment lines
 - Levistein distance rows (or maybe just use row 'form's)
Add outline code only to VS Extension

YouTube speed:
   vid = document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream html5-main-video")[0];
   vid.playbackRate=3.0;

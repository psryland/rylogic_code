	// Elasticity and friction:
	//  Elasticity is how bouncy a material is in the normal direction.
	//  Friction is how sticky a material is in the tangential direction.
	//  The normal and torsion components of the outbound velocity are controlled by elasticity.
	//  Friction is used to limit the size of the tangential component of the impulse which effects the
	//  outbound tangential velocity.
	//  See comments in the implementation below

	// Helper function for initialising dsound for an app
	// Device:
	//   0 = use the primary sound driver
	// Flags:
	//  DSSCL_EXCLUSIVE - For DirectX 8.0 and later, has the same effect as DSSCL_PRIORITY. For previous versions, sets the application to
	//      the exclusive level. This means that when it has the input focus, the application will be the only one audible; sounds from
	//      applications with the DSBCAPS_GLOBALFOCUS flag set will be muted. With this level, it also has all the privileges of the
	//      DSSCL_PRIORITY level. DirectSound will restore the hardware format, as specified by the most recent call to the SetFormat
	//      method, after the application gains the input focus.
	//  DSSCL_NORMAL - Sets the normal level. This level has the smoothest multitasking and resource-sharing behavior, but because it
	//      does not allow the primary buffer format to change, output is restricted to the default 8-bit format.
	//  DSSCL_PRIORITY - Sets the priority level. Applications with this cooperative level can call the SetFormat and Compact methods.
	//  DSSCL_WRITEPRIMARY - Sets the write-primary level. The application has write access to the primary buffer. No secondary buffers
	//      can be played. This level cannot be set if the DirectSound driver is being emulated for the device; that is, if the GetCaps
	//      method returns the DSCAPS_EMULDRIVER flag in the DSCAPS structure.

	// Helper function for allocating a dsound buffer
	// Flags:
	//  DSBCAPS_CTRL3D - The buffer has 3D control capability.
	//  DSBCAPS_CTRLFREQUENCY - The buffer has frequency control capability.
	//  DSBCAPS_CTRLFX - The buffer supports effects processing.
	//  DSBCAPS_CTRLPAN - The buffer has pan control capability.
	//  DSBCAPS_CTRLVOLUME - The buffer has volume control capability.
	//  DSBCAPS_CTRLPOSITIONNOTIFY - The buffer has position notification capability. See the Remarks for DSCBUFFERDESC.
	//  DSBCAPS_GETCURRENTPOSITION2 - The buffer uses the new behavior of the play cursor when IDirectSoundBuffer8::GetCurrentPosition
	//        is called. In the first version of DirectSound, the play cursor was significantly ahead of the actual playing
	//        sound on emulated sound cards; it was directly behind the write cursor. Now, if the DSBCAPS_GETCURRENTPOSITION2
	//        flag is specified, the application can get a more accurate play cursor. If this flag is not specified, the old
	//        behavior is preserved for compatibility. This flag affects only emulated devices; if a DirectSound driver is
	//        present, the play cursor is accurate for DirectSound in all versions of DirectX.
	//  DSBCAPS_GLOBALFOCUS - The buffer is a global sound buffer. With this flag set, an application using DirectSound can continue to
	//        play its buffers if the user switches focus to another application, even if the new application uses DirectSound.
	//        The one exception is if you switch focus to a DirectSound application that uses the DSSCL_WRITEPRIMARY flag for
	//        its cooperative level. In this case, the global sounds from other applications will not be audible.
	//  DSBCAPS_LOCDEFER - The buffer can be assigned to a hardware or software resource at play time, or when IDirectSoundBuffer8::AcquireResources is called.
	//  DSBCAPS_LOCHARDWARE - The buffer uses hardware mixing.
	//  DSBCAPS_LOCSOFTWARE - The buffer is in software memory and uses software mixing.
	//  DSBCAPS_MUTE3DATMAXDISTANCE - The sound is reduced to silence at the maximum distance. The buffer will stop playing when the
	//        maximum distance is exceeded, so that processor time is not wasted. Applies only to software buffers.
	// DSBCAPS_PRIMARYBUFFER - The buffer is a primary buffer.
	// DSBCAPS_STATIC - The buffer is in on-board hardware memory.
	// DSBCAPS_STICKYFOCUS - The buffer has sticky focus. If the user switches to another application not using DirectSound, the buffer
	//        is still audible. However, if the user switches to another DirectSound application, the buffer is muted.
	// DSBCAPS_TRUEPLAYPOSITION - Force IDirectSoundBuffer8::GetCurrentPosition to return the buffer's true play position.
	//        This flag is only valid in Windows Vista.
	// 3D Algorithms:
	//  DS3DALG_DEFAULT - DirectSound uses the default algorithm. In most cases this is DS3DALG_NO_VIRTUALIZATION.
	//        On WDM drivers, if the user has selected a surround sound speaker configuration in Control Panel,
	//        the sound is panned among the available directional speakers.
	//        Applies to software mixing only. Available on WDM or Vxd Drivers.
	//  DS3DALG_NO_VIRTUALIZATION - 3D output is mapped onto normal left and right stereo panning.
	//        At 90 degrees to the left, the sound is coming out of only the left speaker; at 90 degrees to the right,
	//        sound is coming out of only the right speaker. The vertical axis is ignored except for scaling of volume due
	//        to distance. Doppler shift and volume scaling are still applied, but the 3D filtering is not performed on this
	//        buffer. This is the most efficient software implementation, but provides no virtual 3D audio effect.
	//        When the DS3DALG_NO_VIRTUALIZATION algorithm is specified, HRTF processing will not be done.
	//        Because DS3DALG_NO_VIRTUALIZATION uses only normal stereo panning, a buffer created with this algorithm may be
	//        accelerated by a 2D hardware voice if no free 3D hardware voices are available.
	//        Applies to software mixing only. Available on WDM or Vxd Drivers.
	//  DS3DALG_HRTF_FULL - The 3D API is processed with the high quality 3D audio algorithm. This algorithm gives the highest quality 3D
	//        audio effect, but uses more CPU cycles. Applies to software mixing only. Available on Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition and later operating systems when using WDM drivers.
	//  DS3DALG_HRTF_LIGHT - The 3D API is processed with the efficient 3D audio algorithm. This algorithm gives a good 3D audio effect,
	//        but uses fewer CPU cycles than DS3DALG_HRTF_FULL. Applies to software mixing only. Available on Windows 98 Second Edition and later operating systems when using WDM drivers.

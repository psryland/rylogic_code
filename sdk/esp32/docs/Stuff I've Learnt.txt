ESP32 S3 dev board

- There is a 'RGB' solder bridge you need to connect on the board to enable the RGB LED
- The built-in RGB LED is actually on pin 47, not 48. Don't use the RGB_BUILTIN macro

- The JTAG port on pins 39-42 is not physically connected. To enable it you need to burn an "E-Fuse" which permenantly disables the USB JTAG

- ESP32 support was added to OpenOCD around 2019

- You need to manually install the "E:\ESP\tools\idf-driver\idf-driver-esp32-usb-jtag-2021-07-15\USB_JTAG_debug_unit.inf" driver. The install process doesn't seem to work. When you do, you can connect with openocd, using the config:
```
source [find interface/esp_usb_jtag.cfg]
transport select "jtag"
adapter speed 40000
source [find target/esp32s3.cfg]
```
Although, you don't need to use openocd manually. The platformio extension has openocd as part of it.

- Plug the USB cable into the 'USB' port, not the 'COM' port for JTAG debugging
